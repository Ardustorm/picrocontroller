* To get UART working on Raspi3 (and zeroW)
  https://www.circuits.dk/setup-raspberry-pi-3-gpio-uart/
  The uart for these pi's is used primarily for bluetooth, so we need to enable and switch which uart port is used. (I think we also need to disable the console stuff since that uses the uart port by default.)

  (another reference, probablly should use this next time:)
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md




* Forth GPIO control:
  omode-pp PB12 io-mode!
  PB12 ioc! \ clear
  PB12 ios! \ set
  PB12 iox! \ xor
