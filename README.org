#+Title: Picrocontroller

Picrocontroller is a python (and maybe C) library designed to simplify
controling hardware from a computer (such as a raspberry pi) over serial.
It currently utilizes an stm32 running the [[https://github.com/hexagon5un/hackaday-forth][Hackaday Edition of
Mecrisp-Stellaris]], an implementation of forth. 


* Goal
  The eventual goal of this project is to create a system that makes it
  easy for an individual to program and control a robot without needing
  much experience with hardware.
